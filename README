Net/Whois/IANA version 0.23
===========================

  This is a simple module to extract the descriptive whois
information about various IPs as they are stored in the five
regional whois registries of IANA - RIPE (Europe, Middle East),
APNIC (Asia/Pacific), ARIN (North America), AFRINIC (Africa)
and LACNIC (Latin American & Caribbean).

  It is designed to serve statistical harvesters of various
access logs and likewise, therefore it only collects partial
and [rarely] unprecise information.

  Various Net::Whois and IP:: modules have been created.
This is just something I had to write because none of them s
uited my purpose. It is conceptually based on Net::Whois::IP
by Ben Schmitz <bschmitz@orbitz.com>.

* Important Note 1:
When make test, sometimes a test may fail merely due to network problems.

* Important Note 2:
When testing too eagerly, i.e. querying the IANA registries too often, you
may get your access to them suspended, temporarily or permanently.
Handle with care!
